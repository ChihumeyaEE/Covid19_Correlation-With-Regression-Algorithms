# Covid19_Correlation-With-Regression-Algorithms

**Goal of this project:** To find if thereâ€™s any correlation at all between the number of covid cases/ covid death rates and temperature in different countries 

Implemented multiple regression algorithms to find which one worked best with our data by looking at the R2 Score and the Root Mean Squared Score 

_*Temperature data is in Celsius_
